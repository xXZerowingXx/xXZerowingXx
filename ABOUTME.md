- 👋 Hi, I’m @xXZerowingXx
- 👀 I’m interested in continue developing anything that may make my business and your business grow, I am actually retired from the 100% of development area but still learning and practicing by myself all my old skills in Java, C# and HTML/CSS/Javascript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit more than I knew about Java, C#, management of new CMS and New Frameworks for me (mainly Laravel)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that help me to grow a bit more as a developer, programmer and computer systems engineer.
